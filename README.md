## JavaScript if/else and switch statements

In JavaScript, there are several ways to accomplish conditional code execution. These are
* `if` / `else`
* `switch`
* The ternary operator `?`

### The JavaScript `if` / `else` Statement

You can find a good tutorial on the JavaScript IF/ELSE statement here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp

W3 Schools also has a good tutorial on the Switch statement: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp 

Here is a good explanation on the ternary operator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
